1. What is a Node module?

A: A set of functions needed in an application to do things. A module is like a JS library and is usually its own file.

2. What is the main difference between exports and module.exports?

A: exports is a reference to module.exports and so cannot reassign the object module.exports. It's recommended to use `exports` unless you want your module be a specific object type.


3. Why is using exports recommended?

It can't accidentally reassign the object module.exports and cause errors. (see q2)
